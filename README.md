# dotfiles
My dotfiles and supporting scripts. These dotfiles are my everyday files I use 
to do my tasks on linux, iPad, and Windows 10 systems. They are a merge of many 
dotfiles and ideas I've picked up via [GitHub] and [thoughtbot] on YouTube.  
My whole hearted thanks to this community.

## Usage
Please fell free to use my dotfiles. I think the best way is to start with a 
and edit it to meet my needs. Please give me feedback if you find a issue or 
just want to give me a thumbs up.
