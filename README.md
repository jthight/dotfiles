# dotfiles
My dotfiles and supporting scripts. These dotfiles are my everyday files I use 
to do my tasks on linux, iPad, and Windows 10 systems. They are a merge of many 
dotfiles and ideas I've picked up via [GitHub] and [thoughtbot] on YouTube.  
My whole hearted thanks to this community.

## Usage
Please fell free to use my dotfiles. I think the best way to start is to use 
snips and ideas and then edit them to meet your needs. Please give me feedback 
if you find a issue or just want to comment or give me a thumbs up.
